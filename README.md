"# TimerApp" 

This is a simple Timer App. It has a terrible GUI. If you want a challenge, then try fixing the GUI. Yes, I know my code is shit.
It just a bunch of random functions and variables. But hey I tried...

The test.py file was just a example for me. 

The build,dist, and timer.spec files are just some random files. Don't worry about them. They appeared when I was trying to make the .py into a .exe file, to make it an app, but it didn't work due to windows defender.
